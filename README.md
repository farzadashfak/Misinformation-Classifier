# Misinformation-Classifier

# Spam Classifier #
This is a fake news classifier created using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization and the Passive Aggressive Classification Algorithm on a pre-existing dataset. This model has an accuracy of 93.05%, and results are analyzed & depicted using a confusion matrix.

## Passive Aggressive Classification Algorithm ##

Passive Aggressive Classifier belongs to the category of online learning algorithms in machine learning. It works by responding as passive for correct classifications and responding as aggressive for any miscalculation.

## TF-IDF Method ##
The intuition of the tf-idf method is to give high weight to any term that often appears in a particular document, but not in many documents in the corpus. If a word appears often in a particular document, but not in many documents, it is likely to be very descriptive of the contents of that document.

## Stop Words ##
Stop words are a set of commonly used words in any language. For example, in English, “the”, “is” and “and”, would easily qualify as stop words. In NLP and text mining applications, stop words are used to eliminate unimportant words, allowing applications to focus on the important words instead.
